# INTRODUCTION

The dataset that I am using in this project was found on Kaggle, the well-known Machine Learning Competition website.
[Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database) for a full description of the dataset, or read the [description file](dataset_description.md).  

I worked in the automotive industry for 12 years and I remain a devoted pistonhead, so getting a better understanding of the used car market was very appealing.

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis phase of the dataset. As such, it will not follow a very structured approach but should be considered more as exploratory notes and observations.

---

# Data Preparation

The dataset is mostly tidy but there are some free text fields and many missing values. Moreover, some of the data is in German and needs to be translated. Most of the translations are straightforward, and Google Translate comes to the rescue where required!
The "name" column is problematic: It is free text which causes all sorts of issues, and although a German NLP engineer could perhaps find interesting information in it, I chose to simply drop it.

```{r}
# Load the dataset in a data.table, excluding "names":
cars <- fread('./autos.csv', na.strings = "", stringsAsFactors = TRUE, 
              drop = 2)

# Convert date columns to POSIXct:
date_cols <- c("dateCrawled", "dateCreated", "lastSeen")
for(c in date_cols) set(cars, 
                        j = c,
                        value = parse_date_time(cars[[c]], "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
head(cars)
str(cars)

```

The column ```abtest``` seems to be internal to E-Bay, probably the ```control``` or ```test``` groups for some internal A/B testing. I don't believe we will need it. The column ```nrOfPictures``` only contains zeros, probably a data collection issue. We don't need it either. I will also drop the ```postalCode``` column, because I don't plan to cross-reference the data with a postal map of Germany although that could be another interesting project.


```{r}
cars[, c('abtest', 'nrOfPictures', 'postalCode') := NULL]  # Drop 3 columns
```

The values in the different factors are fairly straightforward. I translate them into English; at the same time I drop the 12 adds from people looking to purchase a car (```offerType == Gesuch```), as I don't have confidence that they would have accurate information about car specifications, nor sensible asking prices. As a result, we no longer need this column.

The ```seller``` column contains only 3 professional traders. The information is therefore of little interest and we can drop these three observations -- their number is insufficient for any usefull insight.

Finally, I also noticed that some zeros should really be NAs: In ```price```, ```monthOfRegistration```, ```powerPS```.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Keep only private sellers and drop offerType column
cars <- cars[offerType != 'Gesuch' & seller != 'gewerblich', ]
cars[, offerType := NULL]
cars[, seller := NULL]

# Translate factor levels
levels(cars$vehicleType) <- c(NA, 'other', 'people carrier', 'convertible', 
                              'coupe', 'small car', 'estate', 'sedan', 'SUV')
levels(cars$gearbox) <- c(NA, 'automatic', 'manual')
levels(cars$notRepairedDamage) <- c(NA, 'yes', 'no')
levels(cars$fuelType) <- c(NA, 'other', 'petrol', 'cng', 'diesel', 'electric',
                           'hybrid', 'lpg')
levels(cars$model)[which(levels(cars$model) == 'andere')] <- 'other'
levels(cars$brand)[which(levels(cars$brand) == 'andere')] <- 'other'
levels(cars$brand)[which(levels(cars$brand) == 'sonstige_autos')] <- 'other'

# Convert some zeros to NA:
cars[price == 0, price := NA]
cars[monthOfRegistration == 0, monthOfRegistration := NA]
cars[powerPS == 0, powerPS := NA]
```

The ```dateCrawled``` and ```dateCreated``` columns might not be very useful in themselves, but they allow us to calculate how long an ad has been up for on the website, and thus gives us an approximate lower bound for selling time (see below for a discussion on this). By default this value is calculated in minutes, I convert it to days. With this new ```ad_up_time``` variable, we no longer need the other date variables.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Create a new variable for a selling time estimate:
cars[, ad_up_time := as.numeric(lastSeen - dateCrawled) / 1440]
cars[, `:=`(dateCreated = NULL, lastSeen = NULL, dateCrawled = NULL)]

```


We now have a clean and usable dataset:

```{r}
str(cars)
```

---

# Description of Individual Variables

Here, I look at each of the 16 variables independently to understand their distribution.
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

We have 12 variables which I can now plot each remaining variable individually.

## Price
From the summary above, we see that prices go up to over $€2.10.e^9$! This is obviously wrong. While looking at all cars over €100,000 in more detail, I noticed that many of these prices seemed either entered at random or confused with kilometers: I found patterns such as '111111' or '12345678', or modest Seats over €150,000. To try and filter out most of these issues, I assumed that such high-end cars would most likely be coupes, convertibles or SUVs. I also assumed that any price above €200,000 was an error. I then dropped any row that did not match these criteria and looked at the brands of cars above €75,000:

```{r}
# Filter out most likely price errors:
cars <- cars[price <= 200000 &
                 !(price > 100000 & 
                 vehicleType %in% c('sedan', 'small car', 
                                    'estate', 'people carrier', 'other')), ]
cars[price > 75000, unique(brand)] 

```

Some of these brands are not considered premium and it is surprising to find them here. Let's see the models and prices:

```{r}
# Examine non premium brands with prices over €75k:
cars[price > 75000 & 
         brand %in% c("volkswagen", "seat", "ford", "opel", "renault",
                      "smart", "nissan", "mitsubishi")]
```
So we find an array of cars there, some unnamed. The VW Touareg and Ford Mustang seem legitimate. Let's drop the others.

There are also cars below €100, which I assume are also errors or sellers not wanting to filter themselves out of the price selector on the website. I will assign them an NA rather than removing the values, although most of the plots will probably exclude NAs.

```{r}
# Further tidying up of price: 
cars <- cars[price <= 75000 |
                 brand %in% c("chevrolet", "porsche", "other", "mercedes_benz", 
                              "bmw", "audi", "jaguar", "land-rover") |
                 model %in% c("mustang", "touareg"), ]
cars <- cars[price >= 100,]
```

I then plot the variable again with log plus 1 transformation on the x-axis:
```{r "Red bar indicates mean, blue bar indicates median"}
ggplot(data = subset(cars, !is.na(price)), aes(x = price)) + 
    geom_histogram(fill = 'deepskyblue4', bins = 200) +
    scale_x_continuous(trans = "log1p") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = median(cars$price), colour = 'blue', size = 2) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(cars$price), colour = 'brown', size = 2) 
```

Using the transformation, we now have a roughly normal distribution. We notice that some bins have a much higher count than their neighbours, presumably ve The mean is represented with a red line and the median with a blue line.

## Vehicle Type

This categorical variable has 8 levels and indicates the body style of the car (sedan, coupe, SUV etc.)

```{r}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = vehicleType)) +
    geom_bar(fill = 'deepskyblue4')
```

This tends to reflect the general West-European market, with a prominence of "family" vehicles and smaller volumes of "niche" products (although a sample of new car registrations would probably show a higher proportion of SUVs). Also note the large number of NAs -- about 20,000. E-Bay could definitely do a better job at encouraging their customers to write their ads properly.

## Year of Registration

This will basically tell us about the age of the vehicle. From the data summary, we saw that the minimum year is 1,000, which will come as a surprise to most historians. The maximum year is 9,999, which is obviously wrong as we will all be teleporting by then.
So we clearly need to tidy up this variable. To keep things simple, I select only vehicles registered since 1960. As the data was collected in 2016, we set that year as our upper bound. Then we plot a histogram.

```{r fig.cap = ="Red bar indicates mean"}
# Leave out cars first registered before 1960 and, supposedly, after 2016:
cars <- cars[yearOfRegistration >= 1960 & yearOfRegistration <= 2016]

ggplot(data = subset(cars, !is.na(yearOfRegistration)),
       aes(x = yearOfRegistration)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = 'deepskyblue4') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(cars$yearOfRegistration),
               size = 2, colour = 'brown') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = median(cars$yearOfRegistration),
               size = 2, colour = 'blue')
```

The distribution is close to normal, with the exception of three peaks: one in 1999-2000, one in 2005-2006 and a large one in 2016.  
I did some research and it turns out that 1999, 2000, 2005, 2006 were all among the strongest years for new car registrations in Germany in the last 20 years. As they are also in the heart of the used car market in terms of age, it makes sense that they would translate into these peaks.  
As for 2016, the explanation is less obvious, especially a the data was collected in March and April, which is quite ealy in the year. The peak could be due to some listing errors (on purpose or not) where owners enter a date at random or to attract visitors to their ad. It could also be linked to the website's features when creating an ad (eg. default value in drop-down menu).  
But there could also be a number of genuine 2016 cars suddenly arriving on the market. Employees in the automotive industry have often access to cheap car leasing schemes, whereby they can change their vehicle every 6 months or so. More importantly, most manufacturers register large numbers of demonstrators, press units and self-registered cars (new vehicles registered by the manufacturer or its dealers, in order to artificially boost market share and / or create cheaper opportunities to capture some customers over the competition).

## Month of Registration

Maybe this variable will help us explain the peak we observed in 2016 in the distribution ```yearOfRegistration```. We should also note from the summary in the beginning that ```monthOfRegistration``` contains nearly 38,000 NAs. Again, it is surprising that year seems mandatory (although its value is clearly not controlled) but month is not.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(cars, !is.na(monthOfRegistration)),
       aes(x = monthOfRegistration)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = 'deepskyblue4') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12)
```

We could probably turn this variable into a factor -- we will see that brings us any benefit in the future.

## Transmission Type

The ```gearbox``` variable can only take two values: manual or automatic.

```{r}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = gearbox)) +
    geom_bar(fill = 'deepskyblue4')
```

The European market is primarily a manual transmission market, so no surprises here. Again, there are about 15,000 NAs.

## Engine Power

The engine power is measured in PS (which differ slightly from the British bhp). Again, we know from the summary that there are some nonsensical values in the data. I was prepared to remove anything below 40PS, but then I realised that there are [Trabants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant_601) in the dataset! This venerable left-over from the East-German Communist era is now widely used in Berlin as a rental car for people looking for a different experience of the city. Its 2-stroke engine managed 26PS!. Out of respect for such an antiquity, I decided to set the lower bound at 25PS.

As for the excessively high PS values, it looks like most of them are due to people confusing power output and engine capacity (in cm$^3$). I decided to set the limit at 600PS, a more than respectable value.

```{r fig.cap = "Red bar indicates mean, blue bar indicates median"}
# Drop cars with output below 25 or over 600:
cars <- cars[powerPS >= 25 & powerPS <= 600, ]

ggplot(data = subset(cars, !is.na(powerPS)),
       aes(x = powerPS)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = 'deepskyblue4') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 600, 20)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(cars$powerPS), size = 2, colour = 'brown') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = median(cars$powerPS), size = 2, colour = 'blue') +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

The distribution is postively skewed with a long tail (that may contain errors, as we just saw).

There are some prefered values -- around 60, 100, 120, 140 for instance. These are values that have become some sort of "market standards": Most manufacturers will offer engines around these values. It makes it easier for the consumer to compare products.

## Model

This factor variable contails 251 levels, far too many to plot. But we can select the top 20:

```{r}
# Create a data.table of unique model names sorted by their respective counts:
model_count <- cars[, .N, by = model]
model_count <- model_count[order(model_count$N, decreasing = TRUE), ]


ggplot(data = model_count[1:10, ], 
       aes(x = reorder(model, -N), y = N)) +
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'deepskyblue4')
```

Without surprise, the Volkswagen Golf (the most popular car in Europe) is also number one in the dataset. Note the very large number of vehicles designated as "other" -- while some of them are probably models that exist but cannot be selected on the EBay website, it is unlikely that their number would be that high so we have to assume that once again, they are mostly due to human error.

The next car on the list is the BMW 3-Series, which is by no means a cheap car. This fact alone shows that we are indeed working on the German market -- the most high-end market in Europe.

## Mileage

... or more accurately, "kilometreage".

```{r fig.cap="Red bar indicates mean, blue bar indicates median"}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = kilometer)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000, fill = 'deepskyblue4') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(cars$kilometer), size = 2, colour = 'brown') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = median(cars$kilometer), size = 2, colour = 'blue')
```

This histogram clearly shows that mileage is not a free input field. This is surprising, because mileage is one of the most important pieces of information when it comes to used cars, so maximum accuracy would have been desirable. Moreover, when I went to E-Bay myself to try out the used car ad generator, I was able to enter any value. So maybe there is some aggregationg mechanism during data extract?

The second thing that is striking with this chart is the predominance of 150,000km cars. Given the nature of the data, there is no point trying to apply scale transformations to improve the plot. This variable should actually be considered as a categorical variable more than a continuous one. I therefore add a variable in the dataset called ```km_cat```.

```{r}
cars <- cars[, km_cat := factor(kilometer)]
```

## Fuel Type

This factor variable also contains many NAs (over 33,000).

```{r}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = fuelType)) +
    geom_bar(fill = 'deepskyblue4') 
```

"Alternative"" sources of energy are almost negligible in this dataset, which is not surprising considering that over 50% of the vehicles were 12 to 13 years old when this data was extracted.

Petrol is roughly twice as prominent as Diesel.

## Brand

This is another factor with many levels (40) so we will take the same approach as with ```model```.

```{r}
# Create a data.table of unique model names sorted by their respective counts:
brand_count <- cars[, .N, by = brand]
brand_count <- brand_count[order(brand_count$N, decreasing = TRUE), ]


ggplot(data = brand_count[1:10, ], 
       aes(x = reorder(brand, -N), y = N)) +
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'deepskyblue4')
```

The top 5 brands are German. Number 6 is Ford, which in Europe is almost German as it has its European headquarters in Cologne and many of its European products are actually designed and built in Germany. The next two brands are French, then Fiat is Italian. Seat is Spanish but it is actually part of the VW Group and their cars share almost all their components with VW products.  
In other words, German manufacturers are hugely dominant on their home turf.

## Unrepaired Damage

The variable ```notRepairedDamage``` can only take two values: "yes" or "no". But it does have NAs -- about 72,000, which is twice as many as the number of "yes". It does not seem like this is a mandatory field (and I could not find it on EBay). As I understand it, it refers to potential unrepaired damage on the vehicle being sold.

```{r}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = notRepairedDamage)) +
    geom_bar(fill = 'deepskyblue4') 
```

## Ad Up-time

This is a composite variable that we created by substracting the ```dateCreated``` from the ```dateCrawled``` date. It is measured in days. Of course the idea is to look for potential correlations to other variables, especially ```price```. From that point of view, there are important limitations associated with ```ad_up_time```:
 
 - We don't know whether there is any incitation for sellers to remove ads once the vehicle is sold. This means some ads might be really old and unattended despite the car having been sold long ago, through EBay or some other channel.
 - We are not even sure that ads removed from the website cannot be present in the scaped data.


```{r fig.cap="Red bar indicates mean, blue car indicates median"}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = ad_up_time)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 7, fill = 'deepskyblue4') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2000, 120)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(cars$ad_up_time), colour = 'brown', size = 2) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = median(cars$ad_up_time), colour = 'blue', size = 2)
    
```

Here we have observations up to 2,000 days (nearly 5.5 years). The long tail contains a significant number of observations and there seems to be a lot of variance in the data, so it is difficult to just drop observations over an arbitrary number of days posted. But maybe we will have to do it.

The other thing I notice is that there seems to be some prevailing values at roughly three months intervals. I am not sure why this is -- it might be related to the pricing scheme used by EBay...?

---

# Looking for Correlations

In this section, I will examine pairs of variables to look for correlations, and then zoom in on some multi-variable combinations that seem particularly interesting.

One issue we have is that ```brand``` contains 40 levels, which makes plots really hard to read (in addition to causing long processing times with the plot matrix). We can resolve this by grouping brands into categories based on brand perception. We could simply use mean prices to make these distinctions, but we would then create a correlation to price where there isn't necessarily one. Moreover, brand perception involves a lot more than just price -- there is history, perceived quality, marketing etc.

So I chose another approach: Use my domain-knowledge to manually classify the 40 levels into clusters. I didn't plan on an exact number of clusters beforehand, just something manageable. I then intuitively grouped brands together and came up with ... clusters which I then named.  
Althought this intuitive approach is subjective and far more time-consumming, I believe it actually adds information to the dataset, unlike the "group by price" methid which removes some. 

```{r include = FALSE}
other <- c('lada', 'trabant', 'other')
budget <- c('chevrolet', 'daewoo', 'dacia')
budget_plus <- c('hyundai', 'kia', 'skoda', 'daihatsu')
mid_minus <- c('chrysler', 'fiat', 'ford', 'citroen', 'mitsubishi', 'opel', 
               'rover', 'seat', 'suzuki')
mid_range <- c('nissan', 'peugeot', 'renault', 'toyota')
mid_plus <- c('honda', 'mazda', 'smart', 'subaru', 'volkswagen')
premium_minus <- c('alfa_romeo', 'lancia', 'saab', 'jeep', 'volvo', 'mini')
premium <- c('audi', 'bmw', 'jaguar', 'land_rover', 'mercedes_benz', 'porsche')

cars[brand %in% other, brand_cat := 'other']
cars[brand %in% budget, brand_cat := 'budget']
cars[brand %in% budget_plus, brand_cat := 'budget_plus']
cars[brand %in% mid_minus, brand_cat := 'mid_minus']
cars[brand %in% mid_range, brand_cat := 'mid_range']
cars[brand %in% mid_plus, brand_cat := 'mid_plus']
cars[brand %in% premium_minus, brand_cat := 'premium_minus']
cars[brand %in% premium, brand_cat := 'premium']

cars$brand_cat <- ordered(cars$brand_cat, 
                          levels = c('budget', 'budget_plus',
                                    'mid_minus', 'mid_range',
                                    'mid_plus', 'premium_minus',
                                    'premium', 'other'),
                          labels = c('budget', 'budget_plus',
                                    'mid_minus', 'mid_range',
                                    'mid_plus', 'premium_minus',
                                    'premium', 'other'))
```

I then try to visualize variable associations with a plot matrix (to reduce computing time, I use a sample of 10,000 observations):

```{r cache = TRUE}
cars[ , log_price := log10(price) ]

ggpairs(select(cars[sample(nrow(cars), 10000)], -c(price, model, km_cat, monthOfRegistration, brand)), 
        cardinality_threshold = 40,
        axisLabels = 'internal',
        lower = list(combo = wrap('facethist', bins = 100),
                     continuous = wrap('points', alpha = .2)))

ggsave('plot_matrix.png', width = 50, height = 50, units = 'cm', dpi = 400)
```

Even so the plot matrix is too clutered to be easily readable so we will have to build individual plots for the most promising variable pairs. Eventually we would like to be able to predict prices based on the other variables, so let's focus on price as one of our variables for now.


## Continuous variables

### Price vs. Power, by fuel type

The plot matrix above shows that these two variables have the highest linear correlation so let's start here.
I make a scatterplot of `price` vs `PowerPS` with a colour-coding for `fuelType` (and keeping only the two most popular: petrol and Diesel):

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(cars, fuelType %in% c("petrol", "diesel")),
       aes(x = powerPS, y = price, fill = fuelType)) +
    geom_point(shape = 21, alpha = .05, position = 'jitter') +
    scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual',
                       guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE,
                                            override.aes = list(alpha = 1,
                                                                size = 2))) +
    scale_y_continuous(
        breaks = c(300, 1000, 3000, 10000, 30000, 100000, 300000)) +
    coord_trans(x = 'identity', y = 'log10', limx = c(25, 400))
```

There clearly is a correlation between power and price. It seems that for a given power output, Diesel cars are more expensive (not a great surprise considering that modern Diesel powertrains are usually more technologically advanced), but it is hard to tell from this plot. I will separate fuel types, and while we are at it why not also add another dimension:

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(cars, 
                     fuelType %in% c("petrol", "diesel") & !is.na(gearbox)),
       aes(x = powerPS, y = log_price)) +
    geom_point(shape = 21, fill = 'deepskyblue1', 
               alpha = .05, position = 'jitter') +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
    facet_grid(gearbox ~fuelType)
```


```{r}

cars[, .(log_price_cor = cor(log_price, powerPS))]
cars[fuelType %in% c("petrol", "diesel") & !is.na(gearbox),
     .(log_price_cor = cor(log_price, powerPS)), by = .(fuelType, gearbox)]

```

So when grouped by transmission and fuel types, the correlations are all around the 50% mark (slightly higher for petrol automatic), which can be considered as average.

The plots confirm that automatic cars tend to be both more powerful than manual cars. They are also generally more expensive when they come with a petrol engine. This is not so clear with Diesel, although we can say that the lowest prices are indeed higher with the auto transmissions. We will try confirm these observations later using boxplots.

So far, we have found that there is a positive correlation of price with power, and perhaps associations to gearbox and fuel type.


### Price vs. Year of Registration

Another continuous variable with a significant correlation to price (according to our plot matrix) is `yearOfRegistration`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(cars, !is.na(yearOfRegistration)),
       aes(x = yearOfRegistration, y = price)) +
    geom_point(fill = 'deepskyblue4', shape = 21, alpha = .05, 
               position = 'jitter') +
    scale_y_continuous(
        breaks = c(300, 1000, 3000, 10000, 30000, 100000, 300000)) + 
    coord_trans(x = 'identity', y = 'log10', limx = c(1960, 2016))
```

The distribution looks very strange. 

 - The first feature that I notice is a clear positive correlation that looks roughly linear for cars registered from roughly 1992 or 1995 onwards.
 - Secondly, we see a vertical line of observations in 2016, which we had already noticed when looking at `yearOfRegistration` alone. On the scatter plot, we can see that this line includes cars at just about any
 price from a couple hundred Euros to maybe €20,000. Strangely, the bulk of cars just older than this seems to be more expensive, which suggests that they are more probably errors (intentional or not) or people just picking the first year available on the drop-down menu when listing their car. If these cars were really 2016 cars, it would be illogical for them to be advertised at cheaper prices than cars 5 years older. This strongly advocates in favour of filtering 2016 cars out of the data.
 - Thirdly, it seems that cars registered before the early 1990's become more expensive the older they get. This would be consistent with vintage vehicles that tend to gain value as they get older -- typically after 20-25 years, provided they are in good condition and were not too common to start with.

Let's split the data in two with a cut-off in 1991 (25 years ago):

```{r include = FALSE}
cars[yearOfRegistration <= 1991, collector_status := 'vintage']
cars[(yearOfRegistration > 1991) & (!is.na(yearOfRegistration)), collector_status := 'modern']
cars$collector_status <- as.factor(cars$collector_status)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = subset(cars, 
                     !is.na(yearOfRegistration) & yearOfRegistration < 2016),
       aes(x = yearOfRegistration, y = log_price)) +
    geom_point(aes(fill = collector_status), shape = 21, alpha = .05, 
               position = 'jitter') +
        scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual',
                       guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE,
                                            override.aes = list(alpha = 1,
                                                                size = 2))) +
    geom_smooth(data = subset(cars,
                              !is.na(yearOfRegistration) &
                              yearOfRegistration < 2016 &
                              collector_status == "modern"), method = 'lm') +
    geom_smooth(data = subset(cars,
                              !is.na(yearOfRegistration) &
                              yearOfRegistration < 2016 &
                              collector_status == "vintage"), method = 'lm')
```

Let's take a look at the correlation values:

```{r}
print("Vintage cars:")
cars[collector_status == "vintage", cor.test(price, yearOfRegistration)]
print("Modern cars:")
cars[collector_status == "modern", cor.test(price, yearOfRegistration)]

```

The correlation is much weaker for vintage cars than for modern cars because of the greater variance. This variance comes partly from the lower count, but also probably because vintage car prices can vary enormously. They no longer compete with each other and their value depends on factors such as: rarity, quality of restoration, use of original parts only, authenticity (faithfulness to the exact specifications of the car when it came out of the factory), historical value, part usage, car's history etc.

Two cars built exactly the same year, 40 years ago, and selling at the same price back then, can nowadays have orders of magnitude between their current value.

```{r fig.cap="Brown diamonds represent means"}

ggplot(data = subset(cars, 
                     fuelType %in% c("petrol", "diesel") & !is.na(gearbox)),
       aes(x = fuelType, y = price)) +
    geom_boxplot(colour = 'deepskyblue4', fill = 'deepskyblue1') +
    geom_point(aes(x = fuelType, y = price), stat = 'summary', fun.y = mean,
               shape = 18, 
               size = 4, colour = 'brown') +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50000)) +
    facet_wrap(~ gearbox)
```


This confirms that prices are generally higher for auto transmissions than for manuals, and also higher for Diesel cars than petrol. However there is more dispersion for auto and diesel than for manual and petrol, probably due to their lower count in the data. We also notice that there are many outliers. Here I used a linear scale for price but cut off at €50,000, and there are many more outliers above the cut-off point.
