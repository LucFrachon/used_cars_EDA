Exploratory Data Analysis and simple linear regression using a Kaggle dataset

This project looks at the Used Cars Dataset available on Kaggle. The data was scrapped from the Used Cars section of the German eBay website.


I decribe data manipulation, individual variables and bivariate / multivariate analyses.
I then build a simple linear model for predicting used car prices using log transformations and interaction terms.
Finally the Reflections section proposes some ways to improve the data and gain further insights.
