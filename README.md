Exploratory Data Analysis and simple linear regression using a Kaggle dataset

---

## Data

This project looks at the [Used Cars Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database) available on Kaggle. The data was scrapped from the Used Cars section of the German eBay website.

## Content

 * used_cars.Rmd: Main file, in R Markdown format. Open and render to HTML with RStudio.
 * dataset_description.md: Description of the data and its variables.
 * external_references.md: Links to external websites used to document the analysis.
 
## Summary of the project

Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover correlations between variables and the strongest contributors to used car prices.
I decribe data manipulation, individual variables and bivariate / multivariate analyses.
I then build a simple linear model for predicting used car prices using log transformations and interaction terms.
Finally the _Reflections_ section offers some ways to improve the data and gain further insights.
